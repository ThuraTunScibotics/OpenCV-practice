# OpenCV-practice

This is my practices and learning of OpenCV, and I've learned methodes of image-processing & computer-vision techniques: frome basic sense of relation between array and image to object detection and tracking using Python, OpenCV, NumPy and Matplotlib. 

The concepts and topics I've learned:
* Manipulate and open images with NumPy
* The concepts of B&W Gray Scale images and RGB color images practice with OpenCV
* From scratch implementation of 2D geometric scaling and transformation of images
* Image manipulation with OpenCV including smoothing, blurring, thresholding and morphological operation
* Detect objects including edge detection and scratch implementation of canny-edge-detecting algorithm, also grid, shape and corner detection with Opencv
* Feature matching, and Segment images with Watershed algorithm
* Video basics with OpenCv including connecting-with-webcam, drawing with mouse on video 
* Traciking objects in Video
